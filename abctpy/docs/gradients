 GRADIENTS Low-dimensional representation of common-neighbor matrices

   V = gradients(W, k)
   V = gradients(W, k, weight)
   V = gradients(W, k, weight, thr)
   V = gradients(W, k, weight, thr, Name=Value)

   Inputs:
       W: Network matrix of size n x n.

       k: Number of gradient outputs.

       weight: Type of gradient
           "weighted": Weighted gradient (default).
           "binary": Binary gradient.

       thr: Threshold to define top neighbors.
           Set thr =  for default value.
           See CONEIGHBORS for details.

       Name=Value Arguments (binary gradients only):
           See LOYVAIN for all Name=Value options.

   Outputs:
       V: Gradient matrix (size n x k).

   Methodological notes:
       Weighted gradients are eigenvectors of common-neighbors
       matrices. These gradients are approximately equivalent to the
       output of standard diffusion-map embedding of neuroimaging
       co-activity data.
 
       Binary gradients are modules of common-neighbors matrices,
       estimated using the Loyvain algorithm. Detection of these gradients
       is equivalent to detection of eigenvectors of common-neighbors
       matrices with binary constraints. Unlike eigenvectors, the order of
       binary gradients will, in general, be arbitrary.
