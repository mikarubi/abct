 KNEICOMPS Components of neighbor matrices

   V = kneicomps(W, k)
   V = kneicomps(W, k, weight)
   V = kneicomps(W, k, weight, thr)
   V = kneicomps(W, k, weight, thr, Name=Value)

   Inputs:
       W: Network matrix of size n x n.

       k: Number of components.

       weight: Type of components
           "weighted": Weighted components (default).
           "binary": Binary components.

       thr: Threshold to define top neighbors.
           Set thr =  for default value.
           See KNEIGHBORS for details.

       Name=Value Arguments (binary components only):
           See LOYVAIN for all Name=Value options.

   Outputs:
       V: Component matrix (size n x k).

   Methodological notes:
       Weighted components are eigenvectors of common-neighbors
       matrices. In imaging neuroscience, these components are
       approximately equivalent to co-activity gradients 
       (diffusion-map embeddings).
 
       Binary components are modules of common-neighbors matrices,
       estimated using the Loyvain algorithm. They are equivalent to
       eigenvectors of common-neighbors matrices with binary constraints.
       The order of binary components will, in general, be arbitrary.
