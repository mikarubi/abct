 MODEREMOVAL Mode removal from network or timeseries data

   X1 = moderemoval(X)
   X1 = moderemoval(X, type)

   Inputs:
       X:  Network matrix of size n x n, or data matrix of size n x p.
           n is the number of nodes or data points and
           p is the number of features.

       type: Type of mode removal.
           "degree": Degree correction (default).
           "global": Global signal regression.
           "rankone": Subtraction of rank-one approximation.
           "soft": Soft removal of primary modes.

   Outputs:
       X1: Network or timeseries matrix after mode removal.

   Methodological notes:
       Degree correction, global signal regression, and subtraction of
       rank-one approximation all produce approximatley equivalent
       results. The "soft" mode removal makes the network sparse by using
       cubic interpolation to "despike" an initial eigenspectrum peak.
