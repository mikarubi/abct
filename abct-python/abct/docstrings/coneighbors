 CONEIGHBORS Common-neighbors matrix of network matrix

   B = coneighbors(W)
   B = coneighbors(W, thr)

   Inputs:

       W: Network matrix of size n x n.

       thr: Threshold to define top neighbors.
           0 < thr < 1 (default is 0.1).

   Outputs:
       B: Common-neighbors matrix (size n x n).

   Methodological notes:
       Integer-valued common-neighbors matrices denote the number of
       common top-l neighbors between all pairs of nodes. These matrices
       are approximately equivalent to the kernel matrices used in
       standard diffusion-map embedding of neuroimaging co-activity data.
