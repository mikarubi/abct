# abct

abct is a MATLAB and Python toolbox for unsupervised learning, network science, and imaging/network neuroscience.

The toolbox includes three variants of global residualization, the Loyvain and co-Loyvain methods (for $k$-means, $k$-modularity, or spectral clustering of data or network inputs), as well asbinary and weighted canonical and co-neighbor components, and m-umap embeddings. It also includes computation of degrees (first, second, and residual), dispersions (squared coefficient of variation, $k$-participation coefficient), and network shrinkage. The toolbox illustrates the main analyses on example data that can be run fully online in computational notebooks.
