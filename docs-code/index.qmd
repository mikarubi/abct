abct is a MATLAB and Python toolbox for unsupervised learning, network science, and imaging/network neuroscience.

The toolbox includes three variants of global residualization, the Loyvain and co-Loyvain methods (for $k$-means, $k$-modularity, or spectral clustering of data or network inputs), binary and weighted canonical, co-neighbor, and m-umap components. It also includes computation of degrees (first, second, and residual), dispersions (squared coefficient of variation, $k$-participation coefficient), and network shrinkage. The toolbox illustrates the main analyses on example data that can be run online without a local computational environment.
